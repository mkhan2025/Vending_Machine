# Vending_Machine
A project from my data structures course which coded for a vending machine which allows the user to input and order and the vending machine returns the names of the snacks ordered, the calorie count and a total cost for the order. 

After the completion of ecah order,  the vending machine will ask a user if they want to purchase another snack. 

When a user chooses to end their order, vending machine calculates any discounts, then prints areceipt containing information about their purchase
